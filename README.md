===============

"GeoNLP" is a Japanese research project for developing "geo-tagging" tools and libraries, which can analyze and extract toponyms/location names from natural language sentences (currently only for sentences written in Japanese).

This repository contains codes for the tools and the library to develop C++ applications, PHP extension module, and some test codes.


The GeoNLP project is also providing toponym data sharing service, linked open data service and so on.
