Location names dictionaries are not included because they are large.

Please make a directory with name 'geonlp-data', 
and download core dictionaries from
http://www.info-proto.com/resource/geonlp/core-dics.tgz
and untar under the directory.

% mkdir geonlp-data
% cd geonlp-data
% wget http://www.info-proto.com/resource/geonlp/core-dics.tgz
% gzip -dc core-dics.tgz | tar xf -

Or, if you need, you can download other dictionaries from the GeoNLP data server from https://geonlp.ex.nii.ac.jp/ .



If you have a GitHub account, you can use git clone instead.
